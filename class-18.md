## WebSocket :
* is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C.
* WebSocket is distinct from HTTP. Both protocols are located at layer 5 in the OSI model and depend on TCP at layer 4.
* The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP polling, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server.



## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
Packet switching is used to optimize the use of the channel capacity available in digital telecommunication networks, such as computer networks, and minimize the transmission latency (the time it takes for data to pass across the network), and to increase robustness of communication.
2. UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) â€“ a communications protocol that facilitates the exchange of messages between computing devices in a network. It's an alternative to the transmission control protocol (TCP).
3. Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
server socket listens on a single port. ... Multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to.


### Document the following Vocabulary Terms;
* OSI Model :Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. 
* TCP Model :The transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the most important protocols of Internet Protocols suite. It is most widely used protocol for data transmission in communication network such as internet.
* TCP : Transmission Control Protocol.
* UDP : (User Datagram Protocol) is a communications protocol that is primarily used for establishing low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet.
* Packets : a small segment of a larger message.
* Socket :one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network.
