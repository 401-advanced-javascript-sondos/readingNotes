  - push
  - pop
  - top
  - peek
  - isEmpty (boolean)

### push O(1)
push item to stack will always be O(1).because it takes same time.

### pop O(1)
* pop :is the action of removing a Node from the top.
* before use pop we should use isEmpty to ensure that an exption is not raised.

### Peek O(1)
* conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack.
* before use pop we should use isEmpty to ensure that an exption is not raised.

## What is a Queue:
* Common terminology for a queue is :
  - Enqueue 
  - Dequeue 
  - Front
  - Rear
  - Peek
  - IsEmpty
