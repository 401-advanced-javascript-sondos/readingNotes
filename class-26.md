## Component Based UI
* React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* JSX , it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. 
* React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
* After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.
* Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.
* React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks ?
- Vue , Angular , Ember , Backbor ,Meteor
2. What’s the difference between a framework and a library?
- The key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control". When you call a method from a library, you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls you. A library is just a collection of class definitions.
