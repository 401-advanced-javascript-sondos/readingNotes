## 5 steps to simple role-based access control (RBAC)
* RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization. It's important to remember that not every employee needs a starring role.
* RBAC is nothing more than the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. 
* With the proper implementation of RBAC, the assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. Further, it is much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.

 ### Access control lists (ACL) :
 An ACL is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document.
 ### Attribute-based access control (ABAC):
  ABAC, sometimes known as policy-based access control, can use a variety of attributes, including user department, time of day, location of access, type of access required, etc.

## Review, Research, and Discussion  
1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
- The Basic and Digest authentication schemes are dedicated to the authentication using a username and a secret (see RFC7616 and RFC7617). The Bearer authentication scheme is dedicated to the authentication using a token and is described by the RFC6750.
2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?
creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims. The tokens are signed either using a private secret or a public/private key.

## Terms:
* encryption :the method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning.
* token :  an object encapsulating the security identity of a process or thread.
* bearer : is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens.
* secret : digital authentication credentials (secrets).
