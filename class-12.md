## Review, Research, and Discussion  
1. Why is authentication important?
Authentication is important because it enables organizations to keep their networks secure by permitting only authenticated users (or processes) to access its protected resources, which may include computer systems, networks, databases, websites and other network-based applications or services.
2. Why should we be careful about storing a user’s password?
If you do not take the right precautions when storing passwords, you could expose your user passwords to an attacker. Many people use the same email and password combination all over the Internet. If you expose their password, they could be left vulnerable on other websites or web applications as well.
3. What is the difference between hashing and encryption?
Encryption is a two-way function; what is encrypted can be decrypted with the proper key. Hashing, however, is a one-way function that scrambles plain text to produce a unique message digest. With a properly designed algorithm, there is no way to reverse the hashing process to reveal the original password.
4. What is the difference between encryption and encoding?
Image result for What is the difference between encryption and encoding?
Encoding is for maintaining data usability and can be reversed by employing the same algorithm that encoded the content, i.e. no key is used. Encryption is for maintaining data confidentiality and requires the use of a key (kept secret) in order to return to plaintext.
5. What is a token used for?
A token is used to make security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity. While a token is generally used to represent only security information, it is capable of holding additional free-form data that can be attached while the token is being created.

## Terms
* authentication :is the process of verifying the identity of a person or device. A common example is entering a username and password when you log in to a website
* authorization : is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features. 
* encryption : the process of taking plain text, like a text message or email, and scrambling it into an unreadable format — called “cipher text.” This helps protect the confidentiality of digital data either stored on computer systems or transmitted through a network like the internet.
* hashing : is a function which when given a key, generates an address in the table.
* session : a temporary and interactive information interchange between two or more communicating devices, or between a computer and user
* cookie : text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password 
* token : are the smallest elements of a program, which are meaningful to the compiler. The following are the types of tokens: Keywords, Identifiers, Constant, Strings, Operators, etc. Let us begin with Keywords
* Basic Auth : s where the user ID and password-based authentication takes place in a browser-generated input screen.
* encoding : process of converting the data or a given sequence of characters, symbols, alphabets etc., into a specified format, for the secured transmission of data.
* cryptography :  science of protecting information by transforming it into a secure format
