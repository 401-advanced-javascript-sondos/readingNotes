## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
* TCP is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data.
* TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means a connection is established and maintained until the application programs at each end have finished exchanging messages.


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
- Observer Pattern :is a software design pattern that establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects.
- Listener : a procedure in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur.
- Event Handler: is the mechanism that controls the event and decides what should happen if an event occurs.
- Event Driven Programming:  programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs or threads.
- Event Loop : continuously checks the call stack to see if there's any function that needs to run. While doing so, it adds any function call it finds to the call stack.
- Event Queue: is a data structure similar to the stack â€” again you add items to the back but can only remove them from the front. 
- Call Stack: is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions 
- Emit/Raise/Trigger :method triggers the specified event and the default behavior of an event (like form submission) for the selected elements. 
- Subscribe : That means it will subscribe itself to the observable of interest  and wait until it is successful and then execute the first passed callback function.
- database :is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
