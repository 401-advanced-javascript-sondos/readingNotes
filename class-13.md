## What is JSON Web Token?
an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. 


### When should you use JSON Web Tokens?
1. Authorization
2. Information Exchange

### What is the JSON Web Token structure?
In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:
1. Header
2. Payload
3. Signature

* Header :The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used.
`{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}`

* Payload : which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.
 
* Signature : To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

* Do note that with signed tokens, all the information contained within the token is exposed to users or other parties, even though they are unable to change it. This means you should not put secret information within the token.

## Review, Research, and Discussion  
2. What can you do with an authorization code?
- The authorization code is a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token. The code itself is obtained from the authorization server where the user gets a chance to see what the information the client is requesting, and approve or deny the request.
3. What can you do with an access token?
- can be used by the app to make graph API calls. When someone connects with an app using Facebook Login and approves the request for permissions, the app obtains an access token that provides temporary, secure access to Facebook APIs.
4. Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
- It's the most secure flow because you can authenticate the client to redeem the authorization grant, and tokens are never passed through a user-agent.

## Terms:
* Client ID : is a unique eight-digit number generated by the depository participants to easily identify their clients.
* Client Secret : is a secret known only to your application and the authorization server. It protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors. 
* Endpoint authentication: is a security mechanism designed to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to a given network, site or service.
* Access Token Endpoint : is an HTTP endpoint that micropub clients can use to obtain an access token given an authorization code.
* API Endpoint : describes a point at which an application program interface (API) -- the code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other.
* Authorization Code : is a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token. The code itself is obtained from the authorization 
*  Access Token : is an object that describes the security context of a process or thread.
