# React Native

* With React, you can make components using either classes or functions. Originally, class components were the only components that could have state. But since the introduction of React's Hooks API, you can add state and more to function components.
* React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components 
* View component renders a container && Text component allows us to render a text
* <Text> is a Core Component that displays some text and View is like the <div> or <span>.


## Props
react native use props. This lets you make a single component that is used in many different places in your app, with slightly different properties in each place. Refer to props.{NAME} in your functional components or this.props.{NAME} in your class components. 

## state
 we can use state as in react


## React Native
- React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- React primitives render to native platform UI, meaning your app uses the same native platform APIs other apps do. 


## EXPO
Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.


## Ejecting to ExpoKit
ExpoKit is an Objective-C and Java library that allows you to use the Expo platform and your existing Expo project as part of a larger standard native project -- one that you would normally create using Xcode, Android Studio, or react-native init.
